# Federated Learning for Privacy
This research examines Federated Learning as a decentralised approach to machine learning as this technology can address rising concerns related to data privacy and security.

Federated learning offers an alternative approach where models are trained across multiple client devices while their data remains local, potentially revolutionising how organisations implement machine learning in privacy-sensitive domains.

This research contributes to the comprehension of federated learningâ€™s competences and challenges in a decentralised machine learning setting. Future directions include the integration of advanced techniques to combat non-IID data and exploring FL in
healthcare domain (for eg. x ray imaging) where privacy is of the highest priority.
